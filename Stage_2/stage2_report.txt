Stage 2 â€“ Profiling Report

Tested two implementations of the Convex Hull algorithm:
1. std::vector
2. std::list

Input: 10,000 points (from input_large.txt)

Results:
- vector: 0.0045s
- list:   0.0085s

Conclusion:
The vector implementation is faster because it provides better memory locality and enables efficient sorting and access.
In contrast, std::list has more pointer overhead and slower traversal, which makes it less suitable in this scenario.
